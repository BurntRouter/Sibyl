# Sibyl
A Discord Bot designed to detect and warn communities of toxic members by analyzing their messages and building a "social credit score" of sorts.

Planned Featues:

- [ ] Determine a user's emotion based off of their message.
- [ ] Provide users with a "Detriment Coefficient" based on recorded messages and reactions to those messages. This acts as their social credit score.
- [ ] Flag toxic flaming localized to a few channel as an "Area Stress Level Warning" to alert moderators if intervention is needed.
- [ ] Flag specific members as Detriment-Hazards if conversation with them or if just their messages are causing normally well behaved members scores to go down.
